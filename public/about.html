<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a career shifter, becoming a developer after working as a social media manager for a year</p>

<p>I graduated from the Ateneo de Manila University back in 2020 when the pandemic struck, where there was strictly a few opportunities for face-to-face work. That opened the possibility of working online.</p>

<p>I hope to be working at a tech company in the future or maybe work as a high-impact independent contractor, who can deliver solutions to my clients.</p>
